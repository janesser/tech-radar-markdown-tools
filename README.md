# Tech Radar Markdown Tools

Tools for creating a Tech Radar in Markdown and converting it to JSON.

## Overview

This repo contains a set of helper functions for parsing Markdown documents into JSON for use with the [Tech Radar generator](https://github.com/dprgarner/tech-radar-generator).

Both these tools are likely to be superceded by another static site building tool such as Gatsby with MDX.
